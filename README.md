# ComputerMusicProject2015Fall

Project created using open source tools HTML, PD, and some javascript.

This project takes in images one at a time of the users choosing, where the top colors are pulled out of the image. 
From this, the rgb values are sent to PD (puredata), where it becomes music.

Just as they a picture has 1000 words, it also has a song.
